# MEASURES TO REDUCE SPAM

## SPAMMY PULL/MERGE REQUESTS WILL BE LABELED AS “SPAM.”
Maintainers: label spammy requests “spam” and close them. PR/MRs labeled “spam” won’t count toward Hacktoberfest. Contributors with 2+ spammy PR/MRs are disqualified.

## PULL/MERGE REQUESTS MUST BE APPROVED BY A MAINTAINER.
Maintainers accept PR/MRs by merging them, labeling them “hacktoberfest-accepted,” or giving them an overall approving review. Accepted PR/MRs enter a 7-day review window, during which approval can be revoked by the maintainer or by our team.

## BAD REPOSITORIES WILL BE EXCLUDED.
PR/MRs should be useful to maintainers. Repos that encourage simplistic PR/MRs (like adding a name or profile to a list or arbitrarily curating content) will be excluded from Hacktoberfest. Remember: quantity is fun, quality is key.
